# Commercial Insurance Case Study: Claims Frequency Modelling for Pricing and Risk

ACST4005 Case Study (2025)

This case study modelled Poisson claims frequency using GLM, regression trees, and boosting for commercial insurance pricing and risk assessment. Focused on model comparison, performance, and pricing implications.

## Key Tasks
- Fitted Poisson GLM, trees, and boosting models to claims data  
- Compared models using cross-validation and metrics  
- Analysed implications for insurance pricing and risk  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Poisson GLM and boosting for claims modelling  
- Model comparison and performance evaluation  
- Commercial pricing and risk assessment
